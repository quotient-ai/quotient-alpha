      "‚û°Ô∏è The name of the 105-qubit quantum processor unveiled by Alphabet is Willow. This superconducting quantum processor was unveiled by Google on December 9, 2024, and represents a significant advancement in quantum computing technology. Willow achieved a major breakthrough by demonstrating an exponential reduction in error rates as the number of qubits is increased, which is the opposite of what traditionally happens in quantum processors. The chip completed a complex computation in under five minutes that would take today's fastest supercomputers an estimated 10 septillion years to solve, marking a substantial leap forward in quantum computational capabilities compared to Google's previous quantum processors like Sycamore, which had 53 qubits.\n",
